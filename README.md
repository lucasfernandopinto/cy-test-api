# API Testing with Cypress

Hello, this project aims to perform API tests using Cypress, focusing solely on GET requests.
To obtain the requests, I used ServeRest, a project created by Paulo Gon√ßalves to aid in API testing studies. Available at: https://github.com/ServeRest/ServeRest

To run the API locally, simply type "npx serverest@latest" in the terminal.
